# Popees-like Sample Site

This repository contains a lightweight sample landing page inspired by https://www.popees.com/.

Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   git clone https://github.com/jkyranjith-spec/WEB3.git
2. Open `index.html` in your browser (or serve with a static server such as `npx http-server` or `python -m http.server`).

Deploy

- To publish the site with GitHub Pages, enable Pages from the repository settings and set the source to the `main` branch (root).

Notes

- This is a demonstration starter. Replace the placeholder copy, images, and integrate real checkout or Web3 wallet logic as needed.
